Things required to run:

- wine to run jad. We know, there are linux binaries of jad BUT those are
  v1.5.8e, we need 1.5.8g
- python to run most of the tools
- patch to fix the decompiled sources
- minecraft.jar, lwjgl jars, and the linux version of the natives, these can
  be found in your home dir under ".minecraft/bin", the entire bin folder
  itself should be copied into the jars folder
